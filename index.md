# Daniel Pendolino
Senior DevOps Architect | <a href="counterhack.com">Counter Hack</a><br/>

I lead the operations team at Counter Hack, where I design, deploy, and operate complex cyber ranges to support NetWars, the Holiday Hack Challenge, and the SANS Cyber Situational Training Exercise (STX).

I am dedicated to seeking opportunities to improve, optimize, and shore-up systems and ensure that challenge reliability is a constant in all Counter Hack products.
